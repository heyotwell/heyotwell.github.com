				<h4>City Bikes - bike rental service</h4>
				<p><a href="sketches.pdf">Sketches (PDF)</a>.</p>
				<ul>

				<li>Made some assumptions: for tourists or infrequent use first (section A)</li>
				<li>I'm also assuming things like allocation of bikes to stations isn&#8217;t a common problem, and that other parts of the infrastructure work reliably.</li>
				<li>This meant emphasizing learnability and predictability and ahedering to common patterns like a map/list UI for place finding (section B). It also meant an easily-accessed mobile web site rather than downloadable app.</li>
				<li>I've ommitted features for recurring "power users" like: reloadable balances, the ability to report problems with bikes, to reserve bikes ahead of time during busy periods, and so on.</li>
				<li>A kiosk UI would have worked too&#8211;a minimal PIN pad is still required to unlock bikes at stations but this means all the complex logic is in a website not embedded hardware.</li>
				<li>Decided the key choice was between hourly/daily rental (Section C)</li>
				</ul>

				<p><a href="wireframes.pdf">Wireframes (PDF)</a> I've annotated this doc, but some of the decisions I made in this stage were:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>I decided on to include a global &#8220;active rental&#8221; state in a banner that appears sitewide when a bike rental is active. It navigates to a view accessible only during an active rental.</li>
					<li>This lets me limit navigation for the infrequent customer, who's either in the "renting" or "not renting" states. (This wouldn't work well for recurring users who might run a balance, or schedule reservations in advance.)</li>
					<li>The kiosk part of the system isn't shown &mdash; interaction would be limited to a pin pad and basic alphanumeric display. Entering an unlock code successfully would unlock a bike. As much interaction as possilbe has been pushed to the web app here, and real-time synchronization between the kiosk and app isn't necessary.</li>
					<li>When a bike is returned and locked, the rental period automatically ends.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><a href="phones.png">Color mocks</a></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Very basic color versions with a single visual design idea sketched out, showing the central transaction of choosing Hourly/Daily rental, confirming payment, and getting an unlock PIN.</li>
					<li>The big, chunky slab serif face (American Typewriter) is meant to feel approachable and simple.</li>
				</ul>
