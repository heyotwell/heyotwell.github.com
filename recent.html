				<h3>Work by my design teams at Google</h3>

				<h4>Google Cloud Platform</h4>
				<p>My team is responsible for research and design for several major Google Cloud Platform products. Here's a sampling of some of the work we've done. These products can be very complex, and I've kept the descriptions high-level here. Let's talk in person about the details.</p>

				<h5>Cloud Launcher</h5>

				<p>Cloud Launcher is something like an app store for the Cloud Platform, but instead of games or reference apps, it lets customers quickly try out sophisticated developer tools, infrastructure components, or other complex cloud-based software. While the basic metaphor is of an e-commerce product, a key design challenge was designing within our platform's UI component system and visual language of a productivity tool.</p>

				<h5>Billing</h5>
				<p>My team also owns several of the Cloud Platform's management tools, such as Billing and Permissions. While a bit unexciting, these tools are business-critical: our biggest customers need to set access policies to their assets, and to understand or audit their bill, which often covers charges for hundreds or thousands of resources and services.</p>

				<h5>Permissions</h5>
				<p>Permissions lets customers manage access to cloud-based resources. Designing a permissioning system from scratch was an incredibly complex project, and required numerous rounds of iteration. </p>

				<h4>DoubleClick Search</h4>
				<p>I've never worked on a product as complex as DoubleClick Search, Google's enterprise search engine marketing management system. It was a real challenge to work in this domain, and it required constant collaboration with product managers and engineers to understand it. Our design team built strong working relationships with customers and worked hard to understand not just their use cases, but their advertisting strategies and techniques. I'm especially proud of the work we did to create a UX vision informed by this interaction with customers:

				<h5>HTML Prototyping</h5>
				<p>Using an Google prototyping framework I helped create, I built lots of prototypes for DoubleClick Search, including an interactive full UI for testing navigation designs. (This is a non-interactive image.)</p>

				<p>I also made many prototypes of specific interactions, here looking at ways of communicating multiple-selection state.</p>
