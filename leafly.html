				<h3>Work at Leafly.com</h3>
				<p>Leafly.com is the "World's Cannabis Information Resource", and is the most popular site in the rapidly-expanding cannabis industry. We get more than 10 million pageviews monthly to our cannabis dispensary listings, strain database, and News content. My role has been primarily Product Manager, though I've also done all the UX design work below (except where I've noted).</p>

				<h4>Leafly Biz</h4>
				<p>Leafly Biz is used by thousands of cannabis businesses to maintain their Leafly listings, which includes managing menus (typically with several hundred items), running deals, posting updates to Leafly consumers, and updating their business information.</p>
				<p>I led the redesign of the 3-year-old version of this tool using Google's Material Design language with the goal of modernizing and professionalizing this tool, and making improvements to navigation and key tasks such as daily menu management. I was the UX designer on the product, but also wrote bug testing scripts and planned the product launch. Since launch in Fall 2016, I've managed the product as a Product Manager, and work with Sales, Marketing, and other teams to build the product roadmap and develop new features. I also do bug triaging and prioritization with our development team, and work with analysts and marketing to track KPIs.</p>

				<h5>Dispensary Menu Management</h5>
				<p>Cannabis dispensaries manage huge retail product menus (like <a href="https://www.leafly.com/dispensary-info/dockside-cannabis-sodo/menu">this one</a>), often changing them daily. We built menu management in Leafly Biz to allow quick access to updating single or multiple products, and to customize sort order and featured items.</p>

				<h5>Dispensary Review Management</h5>
				<p>Leafly allows consumers to review cannabis businesses. Leafly Biz gives them a daily queue of reviews to read and reply to:</p>

				<h4>Products and Brands</h4>
				<p>In Fall 2016, I helped launch Leafly's Product Catalog. This was a large new initiative for the company, expanding to serve a new business customer base: the growing industry of cannabis brands and the ancillary businesses that serve them.</p>
				<p>I was resposnible for the UX design to extend our business-facing tools to serve that audience. As PM, I also did roadmap planning, and with Marketing and Operations planned the product launch.</p>
				<p>I was also responsible for the UX of a Leafly internal tool used by operations and customer service for client account management and consumer review moderation. (Not shown here)</p>
			
				<h5>Brand Client Profile Managment</h5>
				<p>Cannabis brands can manage their Leafly business listing:</p>

				<h5>Brand Client Product Management</h5>
				<p>Brands can also create and manage product listings:</p>

				<h5>Leafly.com Product Catalog (as PM only)</h5>
				<p>In early 2017, we added product categories to the Catalog, a significant iteration of the product. As PM, I worked with Leafly's other UX designer on the design of the consumer-facing part of the site and worked with Marketing to plan the launch, Operations to define internal processes for category expansion, SEO improvements, and ran regular bug prioritization.</p>
